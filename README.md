# Zanora
﻿Zanora is a minimal and modern CV/Résumé and Blog website template as a Personal Portfolio Template.

This template is mainly made for personal use to showcase your skills, experience and some of your past projects. 

Being able to represent what you do in an amazing and beautiful way is a real matter that may make or break your opportunities. You will get a responsive, modern website that is easy to customize and publish.

Using some unique touches in the design, you may feel different among others. Particles that roll around with some hairy borders and smooth animations would probably be different and distinguished.
